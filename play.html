         <h3>   The Duchess of Padua </h3>
         <h4> A large corridor in the Ducal Palace: a window (L.C.) looks out on
            a view of Padua by moonlight: a staircase (R.C.) leads up to a door
            with a portière of crimson velvet, with the Duke’s arms embroidered in
            gold on it: on the lowest step of the staircase a figure draped in
            black is sitting: the hall is lit by an iron cresset filled with
            burning tow: thunder and lightning outside: the time is night.  
         </h4>
         <p>

 <br>            
MORANZONE: 
Guido Ferranti,
Thy murdered father laughs for joy to-night.
<br>
GUIDO:  confusedly

What, art thou here?
<br>
MORANZONE:

Ay, waiting for your coming.
<br>
GUIDO looking away from him

I did not think to see you, but am glad,
That you may know the thing I mean to do.
<br>
MORANZONE:

First, I would have you know my well-laid plans;
Listen: I have set horses at the gate
Which leads to Parma: when you have done your business
We will ride hence, and by to-morrow night—
<br>
GUIDO:

It cannot be.
<br>
MORANZONE:
Nay, but it shall.
<br>
GUIDO:

   Listen, Lord Moranzone,
   I am resolved not to kill this man.
<br>
MORANZONE:

   Surely my ears are traitors, speak again:
   It cannot be but age has dulled my powers,
   I am an old man now: what did you say?
   You said that with that dagger in your belt
   You would avenge your father’s bloody murder;
   Did you not say that?
